# This is to simulate conditional If-Then syntax. If true, then it will executes something. If false, it will also exexute something which usually different if the condional result is true. For practice, try to change var1 and var 2 value.

var1 = 5 # random value 1
var2 = 5 # random value 2

if (var1 == var2) 
	puts "Value is true" # If true, then prints "Value is true"
else
	puts "Value is false" # If false, then prints "Value is false"
end

gets # pauses command so it doesn't exit immediately
