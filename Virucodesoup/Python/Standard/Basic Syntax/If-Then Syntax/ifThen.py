# This is to simulate conditional If-Then syntax. If true, then it will executes something. If false, nothing happens. For practice, try to change var1 and var 2 value.

var1 = 5 # random value 1
var2 = 5 # random value 2

if (var1 == var2):
	print "Value is true" # If true, then prints "Value is true"


raw_input("") # pauses command so it doesn't exit immediately
